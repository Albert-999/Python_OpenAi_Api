I did some experiments with open ai api. In the first code i tried to stimulate the model to hallucinate, trying various topic with different temperature.
In the second one, i asked to the model if the first 10k prime numbers were effectively prime, he missed more of 80%, even if he's improve his performance from first question to the third.
